# 🍅 Composable computations

Tomato is a library of types and patterns for composing _data structure agnostic_ computations, which can be applied to arrays, streams, trees, or potentially any other structure.  Instead of learning a new, potentially different API for each structure, you can use a single API to build computations for any structure.
